# TSPchallenge
My contribution to a coding competition about the travelling salesperson problem for the company msg. 

For reasons of explainability, I used a Jupyter Notebook, which is this file `msg_code_challenge.ipynb`. 
You can have a direct **preview** if you click on it here in github. 
Unfortunately the preview skips the images, but you can find them in the `img` folder and if you execute the notebook on your own machine.
If you want to read it more in calm, I uploaded the pdf export of the notebook in `msg_code_challenge.pdf`.

To use Jupyter Notebook, it is highly recommended to use the **Anaconda** stack.
You can find the installer here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

The challenge itself was to find the shortest path between the 21 locations of the company msg in Germany.
I used a Branch-and-Bound algorithm to solve this Travelling Salesperson Problem exact and efficiently.
More details about the challenge and my approach are explained in the Jupyter Notebook.

The result I found looks like this:

Looks good to me :)
